## Problem Details

## Problem 1 <br/>

Given an array of integers [2, 1, 2, 101, 4, 95, 3, 250, 4, 1, 2, 2, 7, 98, 123, 99, ...]
Write a function (with linear run-time complexity) to print the following tabular output with â€˜xxx' that resembles a histogram (your output should closely match the sample output below, including "99+" to capture the count for all numbers > 99)

Num | count

1 | xx
2 | xxxx
3 | x
4 | xx
.......
98 | x
99 | x
99+ | xxx
